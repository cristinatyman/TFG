Bachelor’s Thesis of Cristina Tyman


Supervisor: Diego Saez

## Abstract
This project examines political content on video-based social networks, with a focus on far-right ideologies in Spain. We aim to investigate whether the far-right promotes hate speech or negative speech in their posts. Using YouTube as the primary platform, we analyze the official and secondary channels of political parties to understand the discourse within each spectrum. Our study employs Natural Language Processing algorithms from Hugging Face and Google’s Perspective API to assess sentiment and themes in video descriptions posted during 2023. Python’s caption analysis further evaluates sentiment polarity in the five most viewed videos for each channel. Our findings show that far-right channels consistently output higher negativity percentages compared to right-wing and left-wing channels. Furthermore, captions display higher negativity than video descriptions. We also observe a positive correlation between negativity and engagement (likes), especially in right-wing and far-right content. By encompassing both right and left ideologies, our analysis aims for objectivity and comparability.

## Structure and Use of the Code
The code is divided into two parts: one for video descriptions and one for captions. The section handling video descriptions is designed to take a CSV file as input. The provided results illustrate an example using the videos from the VOX channel.
